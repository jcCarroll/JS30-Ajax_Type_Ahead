        const cities = []; // when trying to put data into cities you get a const error. You could change const into let to get the data into cities. When .then(data => console.log(data))); is changed to .then(data => cities = data));. You can just push it into cities with .then(data => cities.push(data))); so you can keep it as a const.

                .then(data => cities.push(data))); // fetch(endpoint) returns a promise that we can work with through .then
